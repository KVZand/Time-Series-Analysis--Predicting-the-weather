# Time-Series-Analysis--Predicting-the-weather
In this project I predict the weather for one day in Hamburg, based on ca. 130 years of data of the station Hamburg Seewarte. After building a baseline model the components of the Time Series are analyzed and the seasonality and trends are filtered out. Based on these observations a model for a future time-steps is build.
